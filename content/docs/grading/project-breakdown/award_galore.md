# Why Awards Matter
Awards serve as a tangible recognition of the dedication and creativity students bring to their machine learning projects. Each semester, these select honors are chosen **from among hundreds of submitted projects**, making the competition fierce and underscoring the ingenuity and motivation of participating teams. By highlighting outstanding work, we encourage students to push boundaries, refine technical skills, and communicate findings more effectively.  

This recognition also benefits students’ academic and professional growth—award recipients can feature their projects on resumes and link directly to showcased work for added visibility. Additionally, **all projects remain live** on the class website for future semesters, ensuring that both current and prospective students can discover, learn from, and be inspired by past successes. This tradition fosters continuity in the course and builds a growing body of shared knowledge. Being featured on the website is thus both an honor and a motivator, inspiring future cohorts to strive for the same high standard of excellence.
