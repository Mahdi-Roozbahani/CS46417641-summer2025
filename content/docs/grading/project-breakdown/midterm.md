## Midterm Checkpoint (10%)

This is a checkpoint to make sure that you have had major progress in your project. By this point, at least one machine learning model should be implemented and evaluated. Results should be presented using visualizations and quantitative metrics. You will add information to your [proposal](#proposal-5) to create your midterm report.

*Note: As part of research, it is natural that the project may change from the original proposed. Please be sure to document and justify any such changes in this report.*

### Midterm Sections & Checklist

1. <u>Introduction/Background</u>: refer to guidance from the [proposal checklist](../proposal/#proposal-sections--checklist)

2. <u>Problem Definition</u>: refer to guidance from the [proposal checklist](../proposal/#proposal-sections--checklist)

3. <u>Methods</u>: Present at least one implemented solution including specific data processing method(s) and machine learning algorithm(s). Explain why your chosen model(s) and method(s) were selected.
    ```
    ✅1+ Data Preprocessing Method Implemented
    ✅1+ ML Algorithms/Models Implemented
    ✅CS 7641: Unsupervised and Supervised Learning Method Implemented
    ✅CS 4641: Supervised Learning or Unsupervised Method Implemented (Supervised is highly recommended)
    ```

4. <u>Results and Discussion</u>: Discuss the results of your methods and present visualizations and quantitative scoring metrics. What does your visualization/metric tell you? Why did your model perform well/poorly? What are the next steps you plan to take?
    ```
    ✅Visualizations
    ✅Quantitative Metrics
    ✅Analysis of 1+ Algorithm/Model
    ✅Next Steps
    ```

5. <u>References</u>: refer to guidance from the [proposal checklist](../proposal/#proposal-sections--checklist)

### Midterm Submission Requirements
**1. Report:** The midterm report must be written on a website hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account). There is no word limitation for this deliverable. Reuse your proposal and make necessary updates and/or additions.

In addition to the [5 sections above](#midterm-sections--checklist), please include the following in your report:
- ```✅Gantt Chart```: list each members’ planned responsibilities for the entirety of the project. Feel free to use the Fall and Spring semester [sample Gantt Chart](/other/GanttChart.xlsx).
- ```✅Contribution Table```: list all group members’ names and explicit contributions in preparing the midterm using the format below.
| Name    | Midterm Contributions |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| Member1 | Contributions         |
| Member2 | Contributions         |
| ...     | ...                   |

**2. GitHub Repository:** Reuse the GitHub repository from the proposal, and add all relevant directories, files, and code. Include a `README.md` file explaining all relevant directories and files using the format below.

`/dir/`: Description of the directory \
`/dir/file.txt`: Description of the file
