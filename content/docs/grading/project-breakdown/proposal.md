## Proposal (5%)

The primary goal of the proposal is to identify a problem that can be solved with machine learning. This includes finding and/or creating a dataset as well as developing a plan for the semester.

*Note: As part of research, it is natural that the project may change from the original proposed. Please be sure to document and justify these changes in the midterm and final report.*

### Proposal Sections & Checklist

1. <u>Introduction/Background</u>: Provide an introduction of your topic and literature review of related work. Briefly explain your dataset and its features, and provide a link to the dataset if possible.
    ```
    ✅Literature Review
    ✅Dataset Description
    ✅Dataset Link (if applicable)
    ```

2. <u>Problem Definition</u>: Identify a problem and motivate the need for a solution.
    ```
    ✅Problem
    ✅Motivation
    ```

3. <u>Methods</u>: Present proposed solutions including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, and elaborate on why you think each will be effective. It is recommended to identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (i.e. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.
    ```
    ✅3+ Data Preprocessing Methods Identified
    ✅3+ ML Algorithms/Models Identified
    ✅CS 7641: Unsupervised and Supervised Learning Methods Identified
    ✅CS 4641: Supervised or Unsupervised Learning Methods Identified (Supervised is recommended)
    ```

4. <u>(Potential) Results and Discussion</u>: Identify several quantitative metrics you plan to use for the project (i.e. [ML Metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)). Present goals in terms of these metrics, and state any expected results.
    ```
    ✅3+ Quantitative Metrics
    ✅Project Goals (recommended to include sustainability and ethical considerations)
    ✅Expected Results
    ```

5. <u>References</u>: Cite relevant papers and articles utilizing the [IEEE format](https://pitt.libguides.com/citationhelp/ieee). All reference in this section must have a matching in-text citation in the body of your proposal text.
    ```
    ✅3+ References (preferably peer reviewed)
    ✅1+ In-Text Citation Per Reference
    ```

### Proposal Submission Requirements
**1. Report:** The proposal report must be written on a website hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/connect-your-github-account). The report must be less than 600 words, and sections (1) through (4) from above count towards this word limit. 

In addition to the [5 sections above](#proposal-sections--checklist), please include the following in your report:
- ```✅Gantt Chart```: list each members’ planned responsibilities for the entirety of the project. Feel free to use the Fall and Spring semester [sample Gantt Chart](/other/GanttChart.xlsx).
- ```✅Contribution Table```: list all group members’ names and explicit contributions in preparing the proposal using the format below.
| Name    | Proposal Contributions |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| Member1 | Contributions          |
| Member2 | Contributions          |
| ...     | ...                    |

**2. Video Presentation:** The proposal video is a 3-minute recorded presentation that summarizes your proposal using Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, or equivalent. **You must create a YouTube Unlisted video and submit the link.** We will NOT accept submissions which are over 3 minutes or submissions that do not use YouTube Unlisted. Not all group members need to participate in the recording. Some criteria that will be used for evaluation are the following:
- Strong delivery that clearly communicates all sections of the proposal
- Effective slide design which incorporates visuals that are interpretable and legible. Any visuals that are blurry, cut-off, or contain illegible text will not be considered.
- Concise and succinct summary of the proposal and all technical content

**3. GitHub Repository:** Create a *private* GitHub repository using [GT GitHub Enterprise](https://github.gatech.edu/) (Please don't use your personal GitHub, just use the GT) all of your teammates and your assigned mentor as a *Collaborator*. There is no need to have any files or code at this point in the repository.

**4. Project Award Eligibility:** Specify whether you would like to opt-in to be considered for the “Outstanding Project” award. Final project website and contributors of winning projects will be featured on our website! Check the [Award Galore](/docs/grading/project-breakdown/award_galore)
